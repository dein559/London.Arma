# London.Arma
London Armageddon  

Initially as a group, we decided that each member would be responsible for a zone. I was in charge of the zone of London.

I collaborated with Michael Dale and cloned his repo. I continued to work on London and blocked out the other zones so I can troubleshoot London first.

As stated, my code is behind what Michael has previuosly delivered, however, i understand it's more vital to deliver a repo than nothing.

I ran into this issue with the code. 
A managed resource "aws_eip" "london-nat" has not been declared in the root module.
